    <!-- write a description of webpage here -->
    <p>
      This tool helps you visualize the notes of a given scale on different flutes, when the composition is being played in a given base pitch. You can enter the scale notes as a string of letters from: {S r R g G m M P d D n N} (case sensitive) separated by spaces, and a base pitch from {C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B} to see the notes on flutes of different pitches. 
      The tool also suggests the best flute to play the scale with minimum half open holes, along with a score suggesting how many open hole notes can be played.
